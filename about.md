title: About Barrett
---

I write fantasy romance where transformation is both magical and emotional—where surrendering to desire doesn't mean losing yourself, but discovering who you've always been.

My stories explore power, connection, and the courage it takes to be truly seen. Expect atmospheric worldbuilding, complex characters, and heat that serves the heart of the story.

When I'm not writing about enchanted towers and impossible choices, I'm probably overthinking the magic systems in my favorite books or planning my next reading binge.

I believe romance readers deserve stories that challenge them as much as they satisfy them.

### Currently Writing

**A Ranger Reforged** - A harem romantasy novella set in an enchanted tower deep in the Alderwood. Expected Fall 2026.
