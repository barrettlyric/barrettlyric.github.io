### Coming Fall 2026

When elven ranger Arivalene stumbles upon an enchanted tower deep in the Deepwood, she discovers sorcerer Jarreth and his three bound companions—women who chose transformation over freedom, power over independence.

What begins as curiosity becomes something far more dangerous: the realization that surrender might not be weakness, but the magic she's been denying herself all along.

As Ari navigates the tower's sensual mysteries and the complex dynamics of Jarreth's household, she must confront what she truly wants: the independence she's always fought for, or the belonging she's always denied herself.
