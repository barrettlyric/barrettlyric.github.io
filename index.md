subtitle: Fantasy Romance Where Magic Reveals What the Heart Already Knows

## Welcome

I write fantasy romance where transformation is both magical and emotional—where surrendering to desire doesn't mean losing yourself, but discovering who you've always been.

My stories explore power, connection, and the courage it takes to be truly seen. Expect atmospheric worldbuilding, complex characters, and heat that serves the heart of the story.

## A Ranger Reforged

**Coming Fall 2026**

When elven ranger Arivalene stumbles upon an enchanted tower deep in the Deepwood, she discovers sorcerer Jarreth and his three bound companions—women who chose transformation over freedom, power over independence.

What begins as curiosity becomes something far more dangerous: the realization that surrender might not be weakness, but the magic she's been denying herself all along.
